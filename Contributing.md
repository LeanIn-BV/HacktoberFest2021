## (☞ ﾟヮﾟ)☞ Contributing to Hacktoberfest Lean In Repository 2021 🔴⚪👩🏻‍💼

### Before Contributing please keep this in mind 🍳

#### Lean In Banasthali's HacktoberFest Repository is strictly against spam so follow these rules for a smooth contributing experience.

### `Contributing to the website`

- We aim to create a website for our college  community `'LeanIn Banasthali'`. 
- We have created a template for you to work upon and would like to change the `content`, the `colour scheme`, the `pictures` and everything which would give it a better shape and structure.
- So, the goal is to convert the template into an `open source website dedicated to the community`.
- You can see the current enviornement of the website by clicking on the **Active-Environments** button on the right hand side of the repository.
- You can raise issues regarding the changes or improvements you would like to do with the website.
- You can make the required changes in the 'index.html' and 'style.css' files.
- The changes can be for example-
- - Adding the relevant logo
- - Replacing the Nav-Bar objects as follows - About -> About Lean In
- - Replacing the Nav-Bar objects as follows - Categories -> Courses
- - Replacing the Nav-Bar objects as follows - Menue -> Mentors
- - Replacing the Nav-Bar objects as follows - Testimonials -> Founders
- Make sure if you are adding any more files for eg some html file, images, etc. They are in a proper folder so that the repository does not look cluttered.

### `Contributing to the SQL Issues`

- There are SQL queries given in the issues domain, assign yourself issues and work on the query.
- Add the solution to the query as a `markdown file` to problems folder.
- Make sure your solution file is in a folder with the following format -> Problems/Issue-name/Issue-name.md

### NOTE

- **Make Sure you commit your changes in a new branch.**
- **Make Sure you Give proper name to your files describing the addition.**
- **Also Make Sure you comment your code wherever necessary.**
